# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees, order them by their title, and see if any of them can mentor future employees.

## Results
- There will be 90,398 retiring employees.
- Senior Engineer with have the most retiring at a count of 29414.
- The Manager will have the least amount retiring at a count of 2.
- There is 1549 employees that can mentor.

## Summary
There are two questions I want to answer.
1) How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
2) Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

For the first question. We will need to replace 7 titles. The amount per title is as follows:
- 29414 for Senior Engineer
- 28254 for Senior Staff
- 14222 for Engineer
- 12243 for Staff
- 4502 for Technique Leader
- 1761 for Assistant Engineer
- 2 for Manager

As for qualified mentors, we only have 1549 with our current parameters. In my professional opinion, if we widen the year by another year or two, we will have a little more wiggle room to comfortably hire and have one mentor 2-3 people.
